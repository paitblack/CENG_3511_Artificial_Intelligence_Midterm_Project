# CENG-3511 Artificial Intelligence Midterm Project
## Smart Path Finder with Leaflet and Dijkstra's Algorithm  

## :bell: There is a detailed report existing in the repo.    

### :gear: Setup Instructions
- Clone the repo.  
- Open any IDE you preferred (Visual Studio etc.)  
- Install required packages (if any).  
- Command "python app.py" on the terminal. (run the app)  
- Click the link provided in the terminal to launch the app in your browser.  

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used  
- **Python** ‚Äî Backend logic, algorithms' implementations and route calculations    
- **Flask** ‚Äî Lightweight web framework for serving the application    
- **HTML & CSS** ‚Äî Frontend structure and styling    
- **JavaScript (inline in HTML)** ‚Äî Frontend interaction logic    
- **Leaflet.js** ‚Äî Interactive map visualization library  

### Definition
This is an application that shows the shortest route on a map. Leaflet.js was used for the map and Dijkstra and A* Search algorithms were implemented.  
On the frontend, you will see only the results of Dijkstra algorithm. To compare A* Search and Dijkstra , you need to look at terminal you use.
